you will need: git-core manaplus imagemagick xtightvnc scrot eterm fluxbox apache2 screen sshd #...









stuff missing:

runmana.sh - contains passwords, starts clients, with -s -U -p -c , and -C pointing to its own config dir in .config/mana

from there is linked ~/config.xml - best set to read-only or modified while clients are off - contains erased users

fstab







todo:





figure out how to optimize the image bitdepth
running the xserver in 8 bits or using montage -depth does not optimize the palette.-> crap
havent been sucessfull trying to make a palettized png with imagemagick yet

easy fix would be
montage -geometry +0+0  -quality 95  cam0.png cam0.jpeg
is almost unnoticable distortion and saves 125kb from the 400kb original

optipng only gets it down to 340

->try other compressors for jpg and png

the vps cpu is pretty limited - it has to be quick too:)

check if apache zlibs it (probably useless)

jpeg - > could do mjpeg



fstab:
currently i have tmpfs	/tmp	tmpfs and i have blank_init.sh
->figure out aufs and replace with an aufs and a tmpfs overlay in /tmp/webcam
#(tmpfs avoids trashing hdd with every screenshot)

too lazy:
phpize the three indexes, make it into a service

train one webcam and take it to candor. if its cool, talk to gms to fix it there
gy cam: talk to gms if we can be invulnerable and automate casting #inwilt there?
